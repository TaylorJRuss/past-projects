The address book one is an assignment where I had to make a program that would add a person to a adressbook you need both AdressDemo and personAddress to pake the program work
first run AddressDemo it will ask you for the persons email first and then their phone number. it will ask you to enter them again for 
confirmiration and the program ends.

for the rest it all goes together for a Truck assignment I had to do once
Run TruckDemo and it will display the properties of 2 different trucks.
