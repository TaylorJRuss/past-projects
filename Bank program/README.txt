Here are java files for my bank program
make sure you have Bank.java, Account1.java, BankAccount.java, and bankDemo.java in he same package'

start up the bankdemo file, once it starts running it will ask for your name and a cash amount so it cam properly simulate a bank account
it will give you 3 options after it gets the previous data 1.Deposit, 2.Withdraw, or 3: end the transaction. just keep going until you want to end the program 
and enter 3.
